# Notebooks Folder

## Purpose
This folder contains **Jupyter Notebooks** for data exploration, analysis, and modeling.

## Guidelines
- Notebooks should be well-documented with **markdown cells** explaining the code.
- Use meaningful filenames (e.g., `data_cleaning.ipynb`, `customer_analysis.ipynb`).
- Avoid committing large outputsâ€”clear unnecessary cells before saving.
