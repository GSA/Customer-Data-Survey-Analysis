# Data Folder

## Purpose
This folder contains raw and processed datasets used for analysis.
## Guidelines
- **Do not commit sensitive data** (e.g., customer PII, survey responses).
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude large or private datasets.
- Organize data into subfolders:
  - `raw/` - Original, unmodified datasets.
  - `processed/` - Cleaned and transformed data.
  - `external/` - Third-party data sources.
