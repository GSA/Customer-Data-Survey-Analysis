# Reports Folder

## Purpose
This folder contains **summary reports, insights, and visualizations**.

## Guidelines
- Store visualizations, charts, and markdown-based reports.
- Use meaningful filenames (e.g., `survey_analysis_report.pdf`).
- If applicable, generate reports programmatically (e.g., Jupyter, Python scripts).
