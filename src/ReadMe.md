# Source Code Folder

## Purpose
This folder contains **Python scripts** used for data processing, analysis, and modeling.

## Guidelines
- Scripts should be modular and reusable.
- Use **logging** instead of print statements for debugging.
- Organize code into subdirectories:
  - `preprocessing/` - Data cleaning scripts.
  - `models/` - Machine learning models.
  - `utils/` - Helper functions.
