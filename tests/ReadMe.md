# Tests Folder

## Purpose
This folder contains **unit tests** for verifying the correctness of scripts and pipelines.

## Guidelines
- Use **pytest** or other testing frameworks.
- Organize tests based on modules (e.g., `test_preprocessing.py`).
- Ensure tests cover edge cases and expected failures.
